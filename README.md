# HumIT
HumIT is an application inspired by the game "Dugout," with a "humming" mode, adding a fun and interactive way to play with selected songs. This project is currently under development.
## Features
- Humming mode: A unique variation of the classic "Dugout" game in which players hum or sing songs instead of simply guessing the title or artist.
- Custom Playlist: Uses Spotify's API to allow users to download songs from a playlist of their choice. This gives players the freedom to play with songs of their own choosing.
## How to play
- Select a playlist: Select a playlist from your Spotify account to use in the game, copy the link and paste it into the app
- Start humming: In "Humming" mode, listen to a song humming or singing and try to guess the title or artist.
